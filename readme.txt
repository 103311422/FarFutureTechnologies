=============================
FAR FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES 0.1.1
=============================

This is a pack containing far-future but possible propulsion technologies. These might not be possible today, but the physics works out, and might be feasible within the next 100 years. 

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- B9PartSwitch (1.5.1)
- Community Resource Pack (6.0.3)
- ModuleManager (v2.7.3)

Recommended
- Community Tech Tree (v2.2+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I highly recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), without this you will have problems with balance

============
KSP-MINI-AVC

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
