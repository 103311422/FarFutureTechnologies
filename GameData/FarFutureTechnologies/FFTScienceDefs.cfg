		default = The occasional energetic particle is detected. It's probably a cosmic ray.

    SunInSpaceLow = The sun is putting out so much radiation pressure that you're better off looking elsewhere
    //SunInSpaceHigh =

    KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems like you might be detecting a few annihilation events.
    KerbinInSpaceHigh = The detector pings occasionally. You'd have better luck lower down.
    KerbinSrfLanded = If there were antimatter here, you'd probably see it. As a fireball.

    MohoInSpaceLow = Your readout reports that it can't hear much over the roar of the solar wind.
    MohoInSpaceHigh = Your readout reports that it can't hear much over the roar of the solar wind.

    EveSrfLanded = The thick atmosphere precludes any gamma ray detection.

    JoolInSpaceLow = What a place to be! It's a veritable jackpot of 0.511 MeV gamma rays!
    JoolInSpaceHigh = The detector reports a number of annihilation events. They're all concentrated down towards that greenish planet...
    //JoolInSpace =

    LaytheInSpaceLow = It's confirmed - the magnetic curtains surrounding this world have trapped antiprotons here.
    LaytheInSpaceHigh = Above the magnetic fields, you're not seeing much gamma flux.
    LaytheSrfLanded = The thick atmosphere precludes any gamma ray detection.
