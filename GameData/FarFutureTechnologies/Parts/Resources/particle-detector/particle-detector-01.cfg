  title = ZAP Energetic Particle Detector
  manufacturer = Post-Terran Mining Corporation
  description = The ZAP detector picks up annihilation events from local antimatter sources. Using this method, it can detect concentrations of the exotic substance. Another subsytem is capable of detecting more pedestrian interplanetary hydrogen concentrations. Also functions as a science experiment, in a pinch.
