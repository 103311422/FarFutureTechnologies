0.2.0
-----
- KSP 1.3
- KSP 1.3 localization support
- Z-Pinch engines received names
- Fixed small nuclear target tank containing 4000 pellets (reduced to 1800)
- Increased visual pulse rate of Z-pinch engines by 25-33%
- Casaba, MicroStar, Pleiades, Polaris engines now use the new ModuleChargeableEngine implementation
- Rebalanced energy usage of all engines, typically now scales with thrurst power (magnetic nozzle field strength)
- Antimatter tanks now have "virtual" contents in the VAB, which are not carried to the pad, for compatibility with KER/MJ DV displays
- Antimatter loader interface now reloads the antimatter count periodically
- Added infinite mode to antimatter factory which sets factory capacity to the maximum (activate with CTRL+SHIFT+A)
- Added new ModuleChargeableEngine system
-- Engine must be charged by a flow of EC for some time before being activated
-- Engines using this method typically don't require as much EC during operation

0.1.1
-----
- KSP 1.2.2
- Added AVC support
- Updated bundled MM to 2.7.5
- Updated bundled CRP to 0.6.6
- Updated bundled B9PartSwitch to 1.7.1
- Added a new ModuleEngineHeatDisplay component to all FFT engines to show engine heat outputs in VAB tooltips and as a right click option in flight
- Reworked entirety of FFT antimatter handling plugin
-- Antimatter is now loaded in the flight scene, provided the selected vessel is at the KSC
-- Loading interface allows loading and unloading of antimatter tanks back into the KSC reserve
- Completed a number of tweaks and improvements to part names and descriptions
- Added better part search tags for many parts
- FusionPellets and FissionPellets have replaced FusionTargets and FissionTargets for compatibility with DSEV
- NuclearSaltWater has replaced NukeSaltWater for clarity
- Normalized all fusion tech parts to use either D-D or D-He3 fusion
- Removed tritium storage from fusion fuel tanks
- Normalized all nuclear fuel tanks (NuclearSaltWater, FusionPellets, FissionPellets) to have mass ratio of 4.0
- Normalized all cryogenic fuel tanks (LqdHe3, LqdDeuterium) to have mass ratio of 5.0
- Antimatter containers now have enough builtin EC storage for 10s of power loss
- NuclearSaltWater tanks have been respecced to be tougher and more thermally resistant instead of having cryogenic values]
- Converted a number of completed textures to dds
- Reworked fusion fuel tank models to look better and obey isotank design language
- Added textures to the inline antimatter tank
- Added KV-1 'Vulcan' Nuclear Smelter: processes EnrichedUranium -> FissionPellets, LqdDeuterium+LqHe3 -> FusionPellets, EnrichedUranium+Water -> NuclearSaltWater
- Added CX-A Particle Scoop: extracts LqdHydrogen, Antimatter from exoplanetary locations
- Added 'Hoover' Atmospheric Ramscoop: extracts LqdHydrogen, LqdDeuterium, LqdHe3 from atmospheres
- Added ZAP Gamma Spectrometer: detects exoplanetary Antimatter
- Added ALICE Imaging Spectrometer: Detects LqdHydrogen (atmo and exo), LqdHe3, LqdDeuterium
