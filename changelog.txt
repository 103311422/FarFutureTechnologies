0.2.0
-----
- KSP 1.3
- Updated bundled MM to 2.8.1
- Updated bundled CRP to 0.7.1
- Updated bundled B9PartSwitch to 1.9.0
- KSP 1.3 localization support for all parts and plugin components
- Lots of improvements to UI components
- Z-Pinch engines received nicknames
- Various changes to nomenclature of engines for better VAB sorting
- Mass ratio of He3/D tanks was normalized to 6 (same as all cryogenic fuels in my other mods)
- Fixed small nuclear target tank containing 4000 pellets (reduced to 1800)
- Increased visual pulse rate of Z-pinch engines by 25-33%
- Casaba, MicroStar, Pleiades, Polaris engines now use the new ModuleChargeableEngine implementation
-- Engine must be charged by a flow of EC for some time before being activated at high draw
-- Engines using this method typically don't require as much EC during operation
- Cochrane engine completely rebalanced
-- Uses new ModuleMultiLengthEngine implementation
-- Engine reaction chamber length can be varied in the VAB between 5m and 30m
-- Higher reaction chamber length gives better thrust (linear scaling) and better efficiency (geometric scaling) at the cost of higher mass and thrust (linear scaling)
- Rebalanced energy usage of all engines, typically now scales with thrust power (magnetic nozzle field strength)
- Antimatter tanks now have "virtual" contents in the VAB, which are not carried to the pad, for compatibility with KER/MJ DV displays
- Antimatter loader interface now reloads the antimatter count periodically
- Added infinite mode to antimatter factory which sets factory capacity to the maximum (activate with CTRL+SHIFT+A)
- The PulsePropulsion plugin was merged with the main FarFutureTechnologies plugin for easier maintenance
- ModuleAntimatterTank's timewarp compensation was removed
- Atmospheric/Exospheric scanners have been completely revamped
-- Now use new ModuleProfilingScanner implementation
-- ModuleProfilingScanner scans detect concentrations at the sensor but also direct a scanning beam in the direction of instrument pointing
-- Running a scan opens a window showing the measured concentrations out into space at a player-defined distance
- Added JR-35B 'Jet' Tokamak Fusion Engine
-- Simple entry level thermal fusion engine using D/He3 and LH2
- Added J-18 'Fresnel' Mirror Cell Fusion Engine
-- High efficiency thermal fusion engine using D/He3 and LH2
-- Uses new ModuleMultiLengthEngine implementation
-- Engine reaction chamber length can be varied in the VAB between 5m and 20m
-- Higher reaction chamber length gives better thrust (linear scaling) and better efficiency (geometric scaling) at the cost of higher mass and thrust (linear scaling)
- Added ST-4L3R Fusion Fuel Tank (3.75m)
- Added ST-824 Fusion Fuel Tank (2.5m)
- Added DynamicBatteryStorage component to distribution for timewarp EC management

0.1.1
-----
- KSP 1.2.2
- Added AVC support
- Updated bundled MM to 2.7.5
- Updated bundled CRP to 0.6.6
- Updated bundled B9PartSwitch to 1.7.1
- Added a new ModuleEngineHeatDisplay component to all FFT engines to show engine heat outputs in VAB tooltips and as a right click option in flight
- Reworked entirety of FFT antimatter handling plugin
-- Antimatter is now loaded in the flight scene, provided the selected vessel is at the KSC
-- Loading interface allows loading and unloading of antimatter tanks back into the KSC reserve
- Completed a number of tweaks and improvements to part names and descriptions
- Added better part search tags for many parts
- FusionPellets and FissionPellets have replaced FusionTargets and FissionTargets for compatibility with DSEV
- NuclearSaltWater has replaced NukeSaltWater for clarity
- Normalized all fusion tech parts to use either D-D or D-He3 fusion
- Removed tritium storage from fusion fuel tanks
- Normalized all nuclear fuel tanks (NuclearSaltWater, FusionPellets, FissionPellets) to have mass ratio of 4.0
- Normalized all cryogenic fuel tanks (LqdHe3, LqdDeuterium) to have mass ratio of 5.0
- Antimatter containers now have enough builtin EC storage for 10s of power loss
- NuclearSaltWater tanks have been respecced to be tougher and more thermally resistant instead of having cryogenic values]
- Converted a number of completed textures to dds
- Reworked fusion fuel tank models to look better and obey isotank design language
- Added textures to the inline antimatter tank
- Added KV-1 'Vulcan' Nuclear Smelter: processes EnrichedUranium -> FissionPellets, LqdDeuterium+LqHe3 -> FusionPellets, EnrichedUranium+Water -> NuclearSaltWater
- Added CX-A Particle Scoop: extracts LqdHydrogen, Antimatter from exoplanetary locations
- Added 'Hoover' Atmospheric Ramscoop: extracts LqdHydrogen, LqdDeuterium, LqdHe3 from atmospheres
- Added ZAP Gamma Spectrometer: detects exoplanetary Antimatter
- Added ALICE Imaging Spectrometer: Detects LqdHydrogen (atmo and exo), LqdHe3, LqdDeuterium
