0.1.1
-----
- KSP 1.2.2
- Added AVC support
- Updated bundled MM to 2.7.5
- Updated bundled CRP to 0.6.6
- Updated bundled B9PartSwitch to 1.7.1
- Added a new ModuleEngineHeatDisplay component to all FFT engines to show engine heat outputs in VAB tooltips and as a right click option in flight
- Reworked entirety of FFT antimatter handling plugin
-- Antimatter is now loaded in the flight scene, provided the selected vessel is at the KSC
-- Loading interface allows loading and unloading of antimatter tanks back into the KSC reserve
- Completed a number of tweaks and improvements to part names and descriptions
- Added better part search tags for many parts
- FusionPellets and FissionPellets have replaced FusionTargets and FissionTargets for compatibility with DSEV
- NuclearSaltWater has replaced NukeSaltWater for clarity
- Normalized all fusion tech parts to use either D-D or D-He3 fusion
- Removed tritium storage from fusion fuel tanks
- Normalized all nuclear fuel tanks (NuclearSaltWater, FusionPellets, FissionPellets) to have mass ratio of 4.0
- Normalized all cryogenic fuel tanks (LqdHe3, LqdDeuterium) to have mass ratio of 5.0
- Antimatter containers now have enough builtin EC storage for 10s of power loss
- NuclearSaltWater tanks have been respecced to be tougher and more thermally resistant instead of having cryogenic values]
- Converted more
- Added KV-1 'Vulcan' Nuclear Smelter: processes EnrichedUranium -> FissionPellets, LqdDeuterium+LqHe3 -> FusionPellets, EnrichedUranium+Water -> NuclearSaltWater
- Added CX-A Particle Scoop: extracts LqdHydrogen, Antimatter from exoplanetary locations
- Added 'Hoover' Atmospheric Ramscoop: extracts LqdHydrogen, LqdDeuterium, LqdHe3 from atmospheres
- Added ZAP Gamma Spectrometer: detects exoplanetary Antimatter
- Added ALICE Imaging Spectrometer: Detects LqdHydrogen (atmo and exo), LqdHe3, LqdDeuterium
